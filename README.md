Telegrip is a GUI digital forensic tool that deals with Telegram-related cases.

Important notes:

- Telegrip tool was built to work with Telegram version (v7.4.1), rooted Samsung Galaxy S6 edge with version 7.0 (Nougat) of Android operating system.
- Telegrip requires a database to store the case's information.

Telegrip provides several features: 

1. Telegrip acquires sparse image from Android devices containing the device information and all Telegram-related data.

2. Analyzes all types of messages, whether public such as channels and groups or private such as secret and normal messages, then it converts them into human readable format to aid the digital investigators during the investigation process.

3. The tool provides analysis of all types of media sent in different types of images, videos, documents, links, and GIF with the identity of the sender and the receiver.

4. Telegrip allows the digital investigator to create digital reports containing all the written comments and evidence selected by the investigator while ensuring the integrity of the report by calculating a hash value for each report. 

5. Telegrip provides the feature of saving the digital case as a password-protected, where the passwords are securely stored using a salted hash.
